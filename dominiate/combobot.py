# Thoughts on a combo bot:
# 
# It should probably run the BigMoney strategy by default; it will not work
# for minimalist (Chapel) or maximalist (Garden) strategies.
# 
# A ComboBot aims to get a certain set of cards. It pays an opportunity cost
# in the number of turns it could have been running BigMoney. How do we compare
# this? I think in the average value of cards it gains per turn, plus possibly
# a constant bonus for trashing useless cards.
#
# We're looking for strategies that gain more per turn than BigMoney would
# after being run for the same number of turns.
